<p>
For kindergarten through fifth grade I attended Monterey Road Elementary School. I then went to Atascadero Junior High School for sixth through eighth grade. 
</p>

<p>
Currently I am attending Atascadero High School and am part of the graduating class of 2020.

My favorite subjects have always been math and science. However, in elementary school I pretty much liked everything. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to math and science, my favorite subjects were graphic design/photography and yearbook.
