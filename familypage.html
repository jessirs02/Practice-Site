My family consists of my dad, Dave, my mom, Angela, and my younger brother, Wyatt. I am super close with my whole family. Especially with my brother who's 11. My dad and mom both have a good sense of humor and are super fun.

<p>
As a family we love to go to concerts and on vacations together. For instance, we go camping in Newport Beach every summer for two weeks and just hang out as a family.
